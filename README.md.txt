# IoT Smart Irrigation System 🌱

## 📌 Project Overview
The IoT Smart Irrigation System automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels. 
It uses a soil moisture sensor to detect soil condition and controls a water pump through a relay module using ESP8266 (NodeMCU). 
The system can be extended to send real-time data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.

## 🔧 Components Used
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module (5V)
- Mini Water Pump
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- External Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Soil moisture sensor reads soil condition.
2. ESP8266 processes the analog value.
3. If soil is dry (value above threshold), relay activates pump.
4. If soil is wet (value below threshold), pump turns OFF.
5. System repeats continuously.
